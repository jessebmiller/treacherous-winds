# Ranger

Play a ranger if you want internal struggle with independance, predation and defending against a wild beast

## Warrior of the land

When you **fight using the terrain for advantage** ask:

- Have you scouted the area?
- Are they less familiar with this terrain than you?
- Did you out prepare your opponent?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict precise or incidious harm
- Impress, frighten, or disorient them
- Hold them at bay

## Skilled Tracker

When you **track a mark or hunt prey** ask:

- Have they been here in the last day?
- Are they unprepared to hide their tracks?
- Is the weather cooperating?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- you find them
- you stay hidden
- you don't travel far out of your way

## Introspective observation

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.md#comprehend) you may spend a hit on:

- Who here has trouble sitting with their own thoughts?
- who here is comfortable with the brutality of the wild?

## Arc

Let your curiosity about the questions in the following acts pull you towards their answers. Don't decide on the answers, play to find them out. Let the table know what questions you're curious about. If you find it helpful, write the current questions you want to focus on on note cards and keep them available for the rest of the table to reference.

Remember all the other PCs have their own similar questions. Cultivate curiosity about theirs. Play to find out the answer to theirs as well.
If there is a question about another character you are particularly curious about let them know but be careful not to impose on their character arc.

Feel free to write your own questions where you are inspired. These are drawn from classic archetypes as a framework but go for the arc you're interested in.

When you complete each of acts 1-4, gain a move from your Path.
