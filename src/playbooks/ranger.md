# Ranger

Play a ranger if you want internal struggle with predation and a fight against the Wild Hunt

## Warrior of the land

When you **fight using the terrain for advantage** ask:

- Have you scouted the area?
- Are they less familiar with this terrain than you?
- Did you out prepare your opponent?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict precise or incidious harm
- Impress, frighten, or disorient them
- Hold them at bay

## Skilled Tracker

When you **track a mark or hunt prey** ask:

- Have they been here in the last day?
- Are they unprepared to hide their tracks?
- Is the weather cooperating?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- you find them
- you stay hidden
- you don't travel far out of your way

## Introspective observation

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.md#comprehend) you may spend a hit on:

- Who here has trouble sitting with their own thoughts?
- who here is comfortable with the brutality of the wild?
