## Of the land

When you **fight using the terrain for advantage** ask:

- Have you scouted the area?
- Are they less familiar with this terrain than you?
- Did you out prepare your opponent?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict precise or incidious harm
- Impress, frighten, or disorient them
- Hold them at bay
- Avoid suffering harm
- Avoid a tough spot
- Avoid a turn for the worse
