## Style and grace

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict precise harm
- Impress, frighten, or confuse them
- Create and opportunity for escape
- Avoid suffering harm
- Avoid a tough spot
- Avoid a turn for the worse

## Sneak attack

When you **attack from obscurity** ask:

- Is your target unaware of your presense?
- Are you able to wait for the best opportunity?
- Did you have plenty of time to prepare?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict any possible harm
- Impress, frighten, or stun them
- Incapasitate them

Risk ideas:
- Suffer harm
- Get caught and recognized

## Mark

When you (**Comprehend**)[../common-moves.md#comprehend] you may spend a hit on:

- Who here is hiding wealth?
- Who here is keeping juicy secrets?
- Who here is aware of me?

## Arc

Let your curiosity about the questions in the following acts pull you towards their answers. Don't decide on the answers, play to find them out. Let the table know what questions you're curious about. If you find it helpful, write the current questions you want to focus on on note cards and keep them available for the rest of the table to reference.

Remember all the other PCs have their own similar questions. Cultivate curiosity about theirs. Play to find out the answer to theirs as well.
If there is a question about another character you are particularly curious about let them know but be careful not to impose on their character arc.

Feel free to write your own questions where you are inspired. These are drawn from classic archetypes as a framework but go for the arc you're interested in.

When you complete each of acts 1-4, gain a move from your Path.

## The enemy

The archetypal enemy of the Rogue is the Puppet Master. A tyrant who manipulates others through subterfuge and lies for power.
