- Inflict precise harm
- Impress, frighten, or confuse them
- Create and opportunity for escape
- Avoid suffering harm
- Avoid a tough spot
- Avoid a turn for the worse

## Sneak attack

When you **attack from obscurity** ask:

- Is your target unaware of your presense?
- Are you able to wait for the best opportunity?
- Did you have plenty of time to prepare?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict any possible harm
- Impress, frighten, or dismay them
- Pin them down
- GM can't choose a specific complication
- GM chooses one fewer complications

GM chooses up to 7 - the roll's highest die complications:

- Suffer harm
- Put in a tough spot
- Caught and recognized
- A turn for the worse

## Roguish charm

When you **seduce, bluff, manipulate or lie** you always count as
having a positive reputation and they never need a reason to be
comfortable.
