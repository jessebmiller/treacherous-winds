# Sorcerer

Start with only the common moves. Gain one each time you complete each of the first four acts of your arc.

**Determining level of arcane complexity:** The arcane moves below use the level of arcane complexity to determine how difficult and risky it is.

To determine the complexity, start with the number of primes and praxes involved then:
* add 1-3 for extreme scales (small, tiny, micro, big, huge, enormous)
* add 1-3 for area of effect (room, city, continent)
* add 1-3 for extreme precision (use your judgement)
* whatever other complexity you think is worth a level

## Arcane Comprehension

When you **push your conciousness into the temporal primes and praxes** to comprehend their secrets:

Ask the GM what you want to find out.

Determine the level of arcane complexity. The GM decides which, if any, are risks and what those risks are.
The remaining levels of complexity are the number of hits needed for a full clear answer.

Roll as many dice as you want.

You may use hits to avoid risks. The rest determine how much you learn. If there are hits left but fewer than you need for a full clear answer, the GM will give you a partial and obfuscated true answer.

Check for arcane fallout.

## Arcane Manipulation

When you **manipulate temporal primes and praxes** describe the set of effects you want to create and how you'll manipulate the primes and praxes here to do it. Describe the outcome or outcomes you want those effects to have.

For each prime or praxis manipulated

Roll as many dice as you want. For each hit choose:

- Achieve an outcome
- Avoid a risk

Check for arcane fallout.

## Arcane Production

When you **maniulate temporal primes and praxes** you may also add any primes and praxes you like to the area for your effects.

## Arcane Specializationin

You may gain this move more than once. Each time you gain this move choose a prime, a praxis, large scale, small scale, area of effect, or precision. The complexity of arcane moves involving your choice is one level less complex.

## Arcane Resiliency

You may gain this move more than once. You may treat any die as a 5 when checking arcane fallout.

## Arcane fallout

When you **check for arcane fallout** sum up the highest 3 dice from your roll and follow the instructions on the tables bellow.
