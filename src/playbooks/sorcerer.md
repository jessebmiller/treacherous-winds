# Sorcerer

Start with only the common moves. Gain one each time you complete each of the first four acts of your arc.

## Arcane Comprehension

When you **push your conciousness into the temporal primes and praxes**:

Roll as many dice as you want and ask the GM 1 question for each hit:

* What is a powerful temporal prime or praxis here? (Sulfur, Mercury, or Salt. Vibration, Force, Charge, Spin, Heat, or Radiance)
* What is an effect the temporal primes and praxes are having here?

You may ask each more than once. The first will give you the dominant prime, praxis, or effect. Subsequent questions will give subtler primes, praxes or effects.

Check for arcane fallout.

## Arcane Manipulation

When you **manipulate temporal primes and praxes** describe the set of effects you want to create and how you'll manipulate the primes and praxes here to do it. Describe the outcome or outcomes you want those effects to have.

For each prime or praxis manipulated, ask the GM and table what is the risk of pushing this too far?

Roll as many dice as you want. For each hit choose:

- Achieve an outcome
- Avoid a risk

Check for arcane fallout.

## Arcane Production

When you **maniulate temporal primes and praxes** you may also add any primes and praxes you like to the area for your effects.

## Arcane fallout

When you **check for arcane fallout** sum up the highest 3 dice from your roll and follow the instructions on the tables bellow.
