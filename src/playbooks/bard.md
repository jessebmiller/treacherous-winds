## Powerful performance

When you **perform for a crowd** describe your performance and ask:

- Does the crowd feel safe and comfortable?
- Is alcahol available?
- Is the crowd seeking entertainment?
- Does the performance reveal, clarify, or support their values?

The audience grants you station with them. You earn what coin your
audience can easily afford.

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- +1 die when invoking this station with them until they disperse
- Gain a bond with anyone in the crowd. What do you bond over?
- Fortify or shift a culture
- Earn extra coin
- Avoid a risk

Risk ideas:
- Someone makes a threat or a demands a favor
- Gain an unwanted reputation

## Practiced charm

When you [**manipulate someone**](../common-moves.html#manipulate-someone), roll with +1 die.

## Social expertise

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.html#comprehend), you may spend hits on the following.

* Who here has juicy gossip?
* Who is in dange of falling in the social order
* who has an opportunity to rise in the social order?

## Arc

Let your curiosity about the questions in the following acts pull you towards their answers. Don't decide on the answers, play to find them out. Let the table know what questions you're curious about. If you find it helpful, write the current questions you want to focus on on note cards and keep them available for the rest of the table to reference.

Remember all the other PCs have their own similar questions. Cultivate curiosity about theirs. Play to find out the answer to theirs as well.
If there is a question about another character you are particularly curious about let them know but be careful not to impose on their character arc.

Feel free to write your own questions where you are inspired. These are drawn from classic archetypes as a framework but go for the arc you're interested in.
