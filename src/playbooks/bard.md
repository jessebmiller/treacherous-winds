## Powerful performance

When you **perform for a crowd** describe your performance and ask:

- Does the crowd feel safe and comfortable?
- Is alcahol available?
- Is the crowd seeking entertainment?
- Does the performance reveal, clarify, or support their values?

The audience grants you station with them. You earn what coin your
audience can easily afford.

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- +1 die when invoking this station with them until they disperse
- Gain a bond with anyone in the crowd. What do you bond over?
- Fortify or shift a culture
- Earn extra coin.
- Avoid a threat or a demand for a favor
- Avoid an unwanted reputation

## Practiced charm

When you [**seduce, bluff, manipulate or
lie**](../common-moves.html#manipulate-someone), they are always
comfortable.
