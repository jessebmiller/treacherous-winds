## Moves

### Martial expertise

When you **fight with martial expertise** ask:

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Pin them down

Risk ideas:
- Suffer harm
- Get into a tough spot
- Get a bad reputation
- Make an enemy

### Expressive violence

When you intimidate someone and [**impose your will with the threat of
violence**](../common-moves.md#intimidate-someone) Roll with the extra questions:

- Have they seen you fight?
- Do you have a reputation with them for brutality?

### Preparation sees preparation

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.md#comprehend) you may spend a hit to ask

- Who here is prepared to fight?
- Who here is affraid of a fight?
- How eager is someone to fight?

## Arc

Let your curiosity about the questions in the following acts pull you towards their answers. Don't decide on the answers, play to find them out. Let the table know what questions you're curious about. If you find it helpful, write the current questions you want to focus on on note cards and keep them available for the rest of the table to reference.

Remember all the other PCs have their own similar questions. Cultivate curiosity about theirs. Play to find out the answer to theirs as well.
If there is a question about another character you are particularly curious about let them know but be careful not to impose on their character arc.

Feel free to write your own questions where you are inspired. These are drawn from classic archetypes as a framework but go for the arc you're interested in.

When you complete each of acts 1-4, gain a move from your Path.

## The enemy

The archetypal enemy of the fighter is the dragon. A dragon is an aggressive, greedy, and violent tyrant. You may make the enemy a metaphorical dragon by highlighting their aggression, greed, violence, and tyrany.
