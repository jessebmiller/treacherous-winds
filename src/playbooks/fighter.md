### Martial expertise

When you **fight with martial expertise** ask:

### Expressive violence

When you intimidate someone and [**impose your will with the threat of
violence**](../common-moves.md#intimidate-someone) Roll with the extra questions.

- Have they seen you fight?
- Do you have a reputation with them for brutality?

### Preparation sees preparation

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.md#comprehend) you may spend a hit to ask

- Who here is prepared to fight?
- Who here is affraid of a fight?
- How eager is someone to fight?

(Designers note: This roll has no hooks into the rest of the game right now and may never, feels like it is likely to be removed but I want to see if it sparks anything. The archetype framework I'm using has these negative aspects of each archetype so I thought I'd stick them in to see how they feel)
