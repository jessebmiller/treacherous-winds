# Fighter

## Martial expertise

When you **fight with martial expertise** ask:

- Are you better equipped?
- Are you ready for a fight?
- Are you taking a defensive position?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict precise or devistating physical harm
- Impress, frighten, or dismay them
- Pin them down
- Avoid suffering harm
- Avoid a tough spot
- Avoid a turn for the worse

## Expressive violence

When you [**impose your will with the threat of
violence**](../common-moves.md#intimidate-someone) you count as angry
and better equipped. They never need to know how you'll get to them to
worry.
