## Martial expertise

When you **fight with martial expertise** ask:

- Are you better equipped?
- Did you see the fight coming?
- Are you exploiting a specific oportunity or in a defensive position?

Roll 1d6 for each 'yes' and choose 1 for each hit:

- Inflict precise or devistating physical harm
- Impress, frighten, or dismay them
- Pin them down

Risk ideas:
- Suffer harm
- Get into a tough spot
- Get a bad reputation
- Make an enemy

## Expressive violence

When you intimidate someone and [**impose your will with the threat of
violence**](../common-moves.md#intimidate-someone) Roll with the extra questions.

- Have they seen you fight?
- Do you have a reputation with them for brutality?

## Preparation sees preparation

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.md#comprehend) you may spend a hit to ask

- Who here is prepared to fight?
- Who here is affraid of a fight?
- How eager is someone to fight?
