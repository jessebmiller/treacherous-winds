# Paladin

Play a Paladin if you want internal struggles with justice and external struggles against hateful zealotry.

## Righteous authority

When you **invoke your position, rank, or station** roll with the extra questions:

- Do they know of your God?
- Do they share your allignment?

Risk ideas:
- your god is displeased
- reputation for unfairness or injustice

## Righteous observation

When you [**comprehend**](../common-moves.md#comprehend) you may spend a hit on:

- Who here is hiding guilt or shame?
- Who here is hiding their intentions?
- Who here is affraid of reprisals?

## Righteous violence

When you **fight with righteousness** ask:

- Do you have weapons and armor well suited for this fight?
- Does your god see this fight as service to them?
- Are you following an omen?

Roll 1d6 for each yes and choose 1 for each hit.

- Frighten, dismay, or stun them
- Cause physical harm
- Drive them back, out, or away
- Avoid a risk

Common Risks:
- harm
- earn a righteous or zealous enemy
- anger a god (yours or another)
- reputation for zealotry

## Smite Evil

When you **cause physical harm to destroy evil** ask:

- Does your god want this destroyed?
- Is the evil past any possibility of redemption?

Roll 1d6 for each yes. Your god may spend:
- 1 to crack the evil
- 2 to shatter the evil
- 3 to kill the evil
- 4 to banish the evil from reality

## Arc

Let your curiosity about the questions in the following acts pull you towards their answers. Don't decide on the answers, play to find them out. Let the table know what questions you're curious about. If you find it helpful, write the current questions you want to focus on on note cards and keep them available for the rest of the table to reference.

Remember all the other PCs have their own similar questions. Cultivate curiosity about theirs. Play to find out the answer to theirs as well.
If there is a question about another character you are particularly curious about let them know but be careful not to impose on their character arc.

Feel free to write your own questions where you are inspired. These are drawn from classic archetypes as a framework but go for the arc you're interested in.

When you complete each of acts 1-4, gain a move from your Path.

## The enemy

The archetypal enemy of the Paladin is the Hateful Zealot.
(editors note: Maybe there is a threats, or monster manual type section with this information)

**Act One:**

Focus: Understanding your home or mundane life and your place within it. (note to self: are these MC moves?)

Answer **4** to move to Act Two.
* What makes your home seem small?
* How do your caregivers or colleagues react to your righteousness? 
* What naive lie do you believe about faith?
* What about your home is unfulfilling?
* What about your home keeps you complacent?

**Act Two:**

Focus: Disruption of your home or mundane life by a Hateful Zealot. Create it as a [world anchor](../setting-the-setting.md#world-anchor).

Answer **4** to move to Act Three.
* What inner conflict do you have about justice?
* What happens that you can't ignore or abide?
* What conflict do you try to avoid and why do you fail?
* How does a zealot threaten your home and what status quo do they prey on?
* What draws you away from home and who must you punish before you return?

**Act Three:**

Focus: Difficulties that challenge your sense of identity. Struggles that force personal growth.

Answer **4** to move on to Act Four.
* What judgement are you surprised to get wrong?
* Who questions your motives and how do you challenge them?
* What failures cause self reflection?
* What challenges expose your potential for judgement, justification, and zealotry?
* What mistake forces you to reflect on your villainous inclinations?

**Act Four:**

Focus: The seemingly insurmountable internal struggle for clarity and judgement and punnishment of the Hateful Zealot.

Answer **4** to move to The Climax
* How does judging the zealot take you even further into the wider unknown world?
* What false victory do you have against the zealot and how do you discover that you haven't won?
* How do you struggle to effectively judge and punish the zealot?
* What value or belief do you betray for a desperate false victory?
* How is the false victory hollow and how does it ruin your aims?
* What fruitless punnishment causes self reflection?

**The Climax:**

Focus: Judging or being judged

Answer this, win or lose, to move on to Act Five
* How do you finally, once and for all, drive your conflict to a final judgement and punishment of one or the other of you?

**Act Five:**

Focus: The lessons you learned about justice and understanding who you really are deep down

Answer all of the following
* Do you embody your own identity, separate from your righteous instincts? How?
* Do you you love yourself more than the power of your god? How?
* Do you sacrifice your judgement and embrace love? How?
* Are you empowered by love? How?

(Idea: roll 1d6 for each yes. If 2 or more hits get the positive archetype ending (hero, king, mage), you may choose a new playbook from the next life phase. otherwise negative archatype (coward, bully, puppet, tyrant, etc.) repeat this life phase, you may choose a new playbook)
