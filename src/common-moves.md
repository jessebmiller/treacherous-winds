feel about this and make any changes needed to keep the game satisfying
for everyone

## Take a risk

When you **take a risk** discuss with the GM what the risks are then ask
the GM how many dice to roll.

Avoid a risk for each hit.

## Comprehend

When you closely study or read or situation or person. Or when you, as
a player, want your character to notice something about a situation or person
ask:

- Has your background or past experience prepared you to understand this
  situation or person?
- Are you unencombered by distraction, tunnelvision, or hurry?
- Do you fear the danger of this situation or person?

Ask the GM 1 question for each hit:

- What happened here recently?
- What is about to happen?
- What should I be on the lookout for?
- What here is useful or valuable to me?
- Who is really in controll here?
- What's being avoided here?
- What here is not as it appears?
- Who is being honest and who is not?
- What is someone really feeling?
- What does someone wish I'd do?
- What would it take to get anyone, or some specific someone to ___?

## Channel magic untrained

The risks for channeling magic untrained do not need to be laid out ahead of
time. The answers to the questions are fuel for the GM to riff on magical side
and unintended effects.

When you are desparate and have no option but to open yourself to what forces
of magic might be here, ask:

- What do you want to happen?
- Who is the person closest in mind?
- What is the place closest in mind?
- What emotions are feeding on all the people present?

Roll as many dice as you want. For each hit choose:

- Get what you want
- Avoid a risk

GM chooses 3 minus the number of avoided risks
- Harming or helping (GM choice) the person closest in mind
- Destroying or enriching (GM choice) the place closest in mind
- Harming or helping (GM choice) the people present
- Anything the GM can fathom
