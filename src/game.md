[--CATS TBD--]

[--The conversation from Apocalypse World--]

## Moves

[--To do it, do it from Apocalypse World--]

### Example

When you **fight untrained** ask:

- Are you defending yourself or someone you love?
- Are you well rested and sober?
- Are you of sound mind not driven by rage or hubris?

Roll 1d6 for each yes and choose 1 for each hit.

- Impress, frighten, or dismay them
- Cause physical harm
- Pin them down
- Avoid a Risk

Common Risks:
- harm
- a grudge against you
- a bad reputation

### First understand the Risks

When a player makes a move, first understand the stakes. Make sure
everyone at the table knows what the character specifically is doing to
make the move and what specific Risks are at stake. The Risks are
a list of things that *will happen* unless the player chooses to avoid
them during their roll (see Rolling with questions below). Talk it
through until players and GM both understand and agree what the
character is doing and what the Risks are.

### Rolling with questions

Most moves will instruct you to answer a few yes/no questions.  Let
the conversation turn to answering these questions. For every question
you answer 'yes' to, add 1d6 to the roll. Moves are the primary source
of the questions, but there may be other sources.
[Allignment](./allignment.md), for instance. Questions
from other sources work the same way. If you answer them 'yes', add
1d6 to your roll.

[-- for an advanced fuckery like section --] Anyone at the table can
ask any question they are curious about and at the GMs discression
those answers might be worth a die for the roll. When the GM grants a
die, they are saying "yes this makes it more likely you'll do well
here". This is a judgement call and different GMs might think
differently about it. For instance "are you afraid?" might be worth a
die when fighting for some GMs but not for others. Or it might depend
on the nature of the situation and the fear. When GMs grant a die for
an ad hoc question, they should consider also if another outcome
option is worth adding. For instance if someone says "Yes I'm afraid
that my grandmother will see me fighting and will shame me for it" a
cleaver GM could add that or a slightly modified outcome
choice. "Yeah, that's gives you a die, but I'm adding a choice. 'Avoid
what you fear, or worse'"

### Hits and outcomes

Every die that rolls a 4 or 5 is a hit. Every die that rolls a 6 is 2
hits.

Most moves have a list of outcomes.  Choose an outcome for each
hit. You can choose an outcome more than once if its clear how that
affects the fiction. Some outcomes describe positive outcomes you are
likely to want. Others describe avoiding outcomes you are likely to
want to avoid. When you choose outcomes that describe positive things
you might want, they happen. Any unchosen options that describe
avoiding some outcome are invitations for the GM to inflict that
outcome on you and the story.

## Principles and Agendas

TBD but something like:

* Play to find out what happens
* Make the world fantastic, horrific, and wondrous
* See your characters grow and change as they discover the wonders and
  horrors of the world
* Ask provocative questions and build on the answers
* Cultivate curiosity about characters arc questions
* Name everyone, give everyone humanity, villainy, or both
