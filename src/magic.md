# Magic

There are three types of magic.

## [Arcane](./magic/arcane.md) magic of [Sorcerers](./playbooks/sorcerer.md), Magisters, and Wizards.

Arcane magic consists of exerting ones will on the primes of sulphur, murcury, and salt through the praxes of vibration, pressure, charge, spin, heat, and radiance that underly all of the temporal world. It risks permenant, troublesome, and grotesque mutations.

## [Divine](./magic/divine.md) magic of [Paladins](./playbooks/paladin.md), Clerics, and Prophets. 

Divine magic is granted by the gods to their worshipers who put themselves in positions to do holy work. It is granted to those who have earned a gods trust.
It requires the difficult and faithful task of submitting to a god who speaks through omens and portents if at all.
It risks punishment for misuse and zealotry from overuse.


## [Natural](./magic/natural.md) Magic of [Rangers](./playbooks/ranger.md), Wardens, and Druids.

Natural magic is the art of mutuality and cooperation with nature.
It risks loss of humanity, becoming feral, drowing in the depth and immediacy of the wild.
