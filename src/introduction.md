# Treacherous Winds

WORK IN PROGRESS: Epic Fantasy Role Playing. Nothing more.
* A big deep fantastic world
* Politics and culture
* Interesting magic systems
* Multiple perspectives
* Long character arcs

This is a System Resource Document (SRD) for a game that hasn't been
made yet.

There is enough here to play but its missing some critical parts. I
hope you'll jump in and try it out then tell me how it goes. That
would be increadibly helpful and right now is the best way to support
me and the game.

You'll find big chunks of this SRD missing with a cold "TBD" if you're
lucky, or just blank pages if you're not. I may reference other games
that you may or may not know or have access to. I might say something
like "Burning Wheel style lifepaths" or "The Conversation from
Apocalypse World" in place of whole systems or sections until I've
written them. These are mostly notes for myself, but if you see how it
would work, by all means try it out and tell me about it.

For insight into how I'm running this play test take a look at [Jay
Dragon's Boomtown
Playtesting](https://possumcreek.medium.com/boomtown-playtesting-0c6536ae48b0)
article.

Join the [Treacherous Winds Play Testing Discord
server](https://discord.gg/dAQG7bcA22) if you want to get more
involved, or just follow along. This server will only run as long as
the game is in development. Once that's over everyone will be invited
to a more permenant home for the game.

I hope we get to play!
