# Playbooks

Playbooks are organized into three archetypeal
categories. **Individuation** playbooks are for those characters going
out into the world making a name for themselves, becoming heros,
finding themselves. **Integration** playbooks are for those characters
learning to lead, integrating themselves into a comminity. And
**Asscention** Playbooks are for those characters discovering
something higher, or outside this mortal realm.
