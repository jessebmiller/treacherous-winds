# The Conversation

[--The conversation from Apocalypse World--]

## Moves

[--To do it, do it from Apocalypse World--]

### Example

When you **fight untrained** ask:

* Are you defending yourself or someone you love?
* Are you well rested and sober?
* Are you in control of yourself and not in a rage or driven by
  hubris?

Roll 1d6 for each yes and choose 1 for each hit.

* Impress, frighten, or dismay them
* Cause physical harm
* Pin them down
* Avoid physical harm
* Aboid being put in a tough spot
* Avoid a turn for the worse

### Rolling with questions

Most moves will instruct you to answer a few yes/no questions.  Let
the conversation turn to answering these questions. For every question
you answer 'yes' to, add 1d6 to the roll. Moves are the primary source
of the questions, but there may be other sources.
[Allignment](./allignment.md), for instance, is another. Questions
from other sources work the same way. If you answer them 'yes', add
1d6 to your roll.

### Hits and outcomes

Every die that rolls a 4 or 5 is a hit. Every die that rolls a 6 is 2
hits.

Most moves have a list of outcomes.  Choose an outcome for each
hit. You can choose an outcome more than once if its clear how that
affects the fiction. Some outcomes describe positive outcomes you are
likely to want. Others describe avoiding outcomes you are likely to
want to avoid. When you choose outcomes that describe positive things
you might want, they happen in a way that's reasonable for the
fictional situation. If you **fight untrained** against a trained
knight in full plate armor while unarmed and untrained, maybe some
small damage to the armor, or exaustion to your opponent might be the
harm.

Any unchosen options that describe avoiding some outcome amount to
permission for the GM to inflict that outcome on you and the story.

## Principles and Agendas

TBD but something like:

* Play to find out what happens
* Make the world fantastic, horrible, and wondrous
* See your characters grow and change as they discover the wonders and
  horrors of the world
* Ask provocative questions and build on the answers
* Name everyone, give everyone humanity, villainy, or both
