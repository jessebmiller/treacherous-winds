# Allignment

There are a number of fundamental dichotomies, pairs of opposed
universal forces in eternal struggle against their opposite.
Characters may allign with one side of one dichotomy or choose to be
agnostic to these conflicts.

The allignments are:

* Lawful vs. Chaotic
* Divine vs. Humane
* Noble vs. Humble
* Agnostic

Each allignment offers some questions that apply to all moves

## Lawful

* Are you enforcing a relevant local, cultural, or religious Law?
* Are you punnishing the guilty?
* Are you prioritizing an institution over yourself?

## Chaotic

* Are you freeing the imprisoned?
* Are you disrupting who claims to be another's master?
* Are you stoking discent at great risk to yourself?

## Divine

* Are you bringing a Divine prophecy to fruition?
* Are you sacraficing a generous mortal pleasure, furnishment, or nourishment?
* Are you rewarding the faithful at cost to yourself?

## Humane

* Are you undermining a Diving prophecy?
* Are you achieving, furthering, or clarifying your own private meaning and purpose?
* Are you deepening a personal relationship (according to them)?

## Noble

* Are you providing societal stability and leadership not otherwise provided by law?
* Are you furthering the goals, ambitions, or reputation of your Noble house?

## Humble

* Are you respecting the limitations of your abilities, position, and circumstances?
