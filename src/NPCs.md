# Non Player Characters

In epic fantasy, and Treacherous Winds, anything from people, institutions, cultures, to magic itself can be a character.

As a GM you'll do some of your world building through creating non player characters (NPCs)

To create an NPC copy the type and subtypes to a card, slip of paper, or whatever digital system
you like to use to organize notes for play.

copy all drives

As you play note anything relevant that you'd like to keep track of, especially bonds and reputations.
Note questions you're curious to answer through the course of play

We learn about any of these characters much in the same way that we learn about characters in epic
fantasy literature. They may be introduced in a flash or slowly. They may be foreshadowed, disclosing
details as hints and clues. A massive claw mark on a cupboard, droppings, a whisper passing through
a crowd etc.
