# Bonds and Reputations

## Bonds

Whenever one chraracter (PC or otherwise) forms a bond with another character (PC or otherwise)
write down, for each side that forms the bond (bonds can be one sided), what is expected and
what is offered

A pair of characters can have multiple simultanious (even contradictory) bonds. A pair of
characters can have two or more of the same bond representing a particularly strong or intense
expectation and offer.

## Reputations

Whenever one character (PC or otherwise) gets a reputation within a group (institution, movement, 
mob, crowd, audience, friend group, establishment, jury anything really) write down the character,
the group, and what the reputation is for. Make a character for the group if there isn't one already
and write it down there. For example: on the Inquisition character, write "Karthitch has a
reputation for insolence", or on the Rivers Bend character write "Stenet has a reputation for
brutality."

If the group isn't worth making a character for, just don't track it.

When a PC starts to get a reputation with a group, tell them so. If their behavior continues,
then give them the reputation. If a PC does something so drastic that it, by itself, gives a
reputation, tell them and ask "do you still want to do that?"
