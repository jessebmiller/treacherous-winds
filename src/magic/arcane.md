# Arcane magic

The moves of the arcane casters ([Sorcerers](./playbooks/sorcerer.md), [Magisters](./playbooks/magister.md), and [Wizards](./playbooks/wizard.md)) will ask them to describe their spells and how they cast them according to the following understanding of magic.

The arcane practitioners can modify, extract secrets from, and in some cases create temporal reality with their will alone.
They are masters of the primes and praxes that the temporal world emerges from.
They have the ability to comprehend, manipulate, and some can even produce primes and praxes directly and at will.

## Temporal Primes and their properties

There are three temporal primes. These are the fundamental materials making up the soul, or the substrate of reality. They each impart their properties to the temporal world that emerges from them, as directed by the temporal praxes.

### Sulphur

Explosivity, flamability, sudden transformation, passion, drive, aggression, impulsivity

### Mercury

Fluidity, flexibility, fusibility, evaporation, smooth transformation, continutiy, indicision, care

### Salt

Stability, rigidity, solidity, calm, stubborness, passivity

## Temporal Praxes and their effects

There are six temporal praxes or methods of emergence. These are the fundamental ways that the temporal world emerges from the primes. Everything in the temporal world is an emergence of some mix and interaction of primes through some mix and interaction of praxes. Rarely does a phenominon emerge from a single prime or a single praxis, though it is possible as in the case of a firefly's glow emerging from just salt and radiance.
