# Character Creation

Character creation is very simple. Choose an
[allignment](./allignment.md), a [playbook](./playbooks.md), and a
[background](./background.md). Then choose pronouns, a name, and breifly
describe your look.

You can look ahead to see what each choice offers or you can choose
whatever catches your eye from below. Write it down as follows.

"I am a [allignment] [playbook]. Once a [background] but no more."

You might write. "I am a Divine Paladin. Once a sailer but no more"
or you might write "I am a Humble Bard. Once a farrier but no more."
There is no need to make choices that seem to go together unless
that's what you want. Feel free to write "I am a Humane Rogue. Once
a baker but no more" or whatever combination you want.

## Allignment

Choose one side of one of the following fundamental oppositions

* Lawful vs. Chaotic
* Divine vs. Humane
* Noble vs. Humble

<!-- * Chaste vs. Depraved -->
<!-- * Civil vs. Wild -->

## Playbooks

Choose one playbook. Multiple players can choose the same playbook. Each playbook has options and instructions for introducing [world anchors](./setting-the-setting.md#world-anchors).

* Fighter
* Rogue
* Bard
* Ranger
* Paladin
* Sorcerer

## Background

Choose a background. Before play tell the table how your background
works where you're from. Whenever there is a quesion related to how your background works, you can feel free to speak up and answer those questions.
