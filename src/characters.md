# Character Creation

Character creation is very simple. Choose an
[allignment](./allignment.md), a [playbook](./playbooks.md), and a
[background](./background.md). Choose pronouns, a name, and breifly
describe their look.


You can look ahead to see what each choice offers or you can choose
whatever catches your eye from below. Write it down as follows.

"I am a [allignment] [playbook]. Once a [background] but no more."

You might write. "I am a faithful paladin. Once a sailer but no more"
or you might write "I am a humble bard. Once a farrier but no more."
There is no need to make choices that seem to go together unless
that's what you want. Feel free to write "I am a faithful rogue. Once
a baker but no more" or whatever combination you want.

Choose one side of one of the following fundamental oppositions.

* Lawful vs. Chaotic
