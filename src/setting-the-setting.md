# Setting the Setting

Before play during the first session create a small mundane corner of a big fantastic world for the PCs to be from. Work with them to find something or some combination of things that works for the table. Feel free to use settings from other games or books as you like.

Choose from the following list or make up your own

* A small farming town
* A small fishing village
* An out of the way keep in a peaceful area
* A traveling caravan of performers
* A herding community
* A mountain mining outpost
* A woodcutting camp
* A remote crossroads village
* The slums of a larger city
* The trades district of a larger city
* An academy and its grounds
* A temple and its grounds

Then, with the players, answer the following questions to establish the setting.

* How do we know that this is a small corner of a larger world? How are people here isolated?
* In what small ways does this place rely on the larger world? In what small ways does the larger world rely on this place?
* How does this place get news from the larger world and how is that news exaggerated or warped? What is some of the latest news making its way through this place?
* What makes the culture here unique?


Begin play by following the threads that lead from your answers.
