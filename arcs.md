# Arcs

In order to highlight how characters change over time and to scaffold the creation of epic fantasy archetypes, Arcs consist of five acts.
Each act is a set of questions to watch for (and steer toward) answers to during play.

There are three basic arcs though each Path (Playbook) has their own variation.

Each PC will be working through their own Arc, and they therefore may get out of sync with each other. That's fine. Though if multiple characters have the same enemy for instance, try to get them all to the climax for the final fight with that enemy.

These arcs are intended to cover the length of a campaign or 10-15 sessions depending on how long you intend to play.

Characters don't need to retire after their Arc. Once I write the Maturity and Ascention Paths (Playbooks) and Arcs, if you complete your arc in its positive outcome (hero for the youthful Arcs) you could start a new arc from the next set of Paths (Playbooks). For instance if you just finished the Ranger you could continue through the Maturity arc as a Warden. You could even switch "tracks" and continue as a Cleric or Guildmaster if that makes sense to your story.

Arcs are split into 5 acts. Each act has a character development focus that the GM and the rest of the table should try to facilitate.
Each also has a set of questions and a threshold of how many need to be answered before moving on to the next act. You could approach this however you want. Either play until you notice that one of these questions has been answered, then point it out, or ask the table to deliberately drive the story towards the answer to a specific question you are interested in. Find your sweet spot.
With everyone trying to facilitate their own arcs you'll have to both help drive the story towards what the other players need and also advocate for the questions you're trying to answer. (Designers note: I have no idea how this will play out at the table. We'll just have to see)

At the end of Acts 1-4 choose a move from your Path (Playbook) as an advancement.
