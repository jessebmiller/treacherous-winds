<p>WORK IN PROGRESS: Epic Fantasy Role Playing. Nothing more.</p>
<ul>
<li>A big deep fantastic world</li>
<li>Politics and culture</li>
<li>Interesting magic systems</li>
<li>Multiple perspectives</li>
<li>Long character arcs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a System Resource Document (SRD) for a game that hasn't been
made yet.</p>
<p>There is enough here to play but its missing some critical parts. I
hope you'll jump in and try it out then tell me how it goes. That
would be increadibly helpful and right now is the best way to support
me and the game.</p>
<p>You'll find big chunks of this SRD missing with a cold "TBD" if you're
lucky, or just blank pages if you're not. I may reference other games
that you may or may not know or have access to. I might say something
like "Burning Wheel style lifepaths" or "The Conversation from
Apocalypse World" in place of whole systems or sections until I've
written them. These are mostly notes for myself, but if you see how it
would work, by all means try it out and tell me about it.</p>
<p>For insight into how I'm running this play test take a look at <a href="https://possumcreek.medium.com/boomtown-playtesting-0c6536ae48b0">Jay
Dragon's Boomtown
Playtesting</a>
article.</p>
<p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/dAQG7bcA22">Treacherous Winds Play Testing Discord
server</a> if you want to get more
involved, or just follow along. This server will only run as long as
the game is in development. Once that's over everyone will be invited
to a more permenant home for the game.</p>
<p>I hope we get to play!</p>

<p>When you <strong>fight untrained</strong> ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you defending yourself or someone you love?</li>
<li>Are you well rested and sober?</li>
<li>Are you of sound mind not driven by rage or hubris?</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll 1d6 for each yes and choose 1 for each hit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Impress, frighten, or dismay them</li>
<li>Cause physical harm</li>
<li>Pin them down</li>
<li>Avoid a Risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>harm</li>
<li>a grudge against you</li>
<li>a bad reputation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="first-understand-the-risks"><a class="header" href="#first-understand-the-risks">First understand the Risks</a></h3>
<p>When a player makes a move, first understand the stakes. Make sure
everyone at the table knows what the character specifically is doing to
make the move and what specific Risks are at stake. The Risks are
a list of things that <em>will happen</em> unless the player chooses to avoid
them during their roll (see Rolling with questions below). Talk it
through until players and GM both understand and agree what the
character is doing and what the Risks are.</p>
<h3 id="rolling-with-questions"><a class="header" href="#rolling-with-questions">Rolling with questions</a></h3>
<p>Most moves will instruct you to answer a few yes/no questions.  Let
the conversation turn to answering these questions. For every question
you answer 'yes' to, add 1d6 to the roll. Moves are the primary source
of the questions, but there may be other sources.
<a href="./allignment.html">Allignment</a>, for instance. Questions
from other sources work the same way. If you answer them 'yes', add
1d6 to your roll.</p>
<p>[-- for an advanced fuckery like section --] Anyone at the table can
ask any question they are curious about and at the GMs discression
those answers might be worth a die for the roll. When the GM grants a
die, they are saying "yes this makes it more likely you'll do well
here". This is a judgement call and different GMs might think
differently about it. For instance "are you afraid?" might be worth a
die when fighting for some GMs but not for others. Or it might depend
on the nature of the situation and the fear. When GMs grant a die for
an ad hoc question, they should consider also if another outcome
option is worth adding. For instance if someone says "Yes I'm afraid
that my grandmother will see me fighting and will shame me for it" a
cleaver GM could add that or a slightly modified outcome
choice. "Yeah, that's gives you a die, but I'm adding a choice. 'Avoid
what you fear, or worse'"</p>
<h3 id="hits-and-outcomes"><a class="header" href="#hits-and-outcomes">Hits and outcomes</a></h3>
<p>Every die that rolls a 4 or 5 is a hit. Every die that rolls a 6 is 2
hits.</p>
<p>Most moves have a list of outcomes.  Choose an outcome for each
hit. You can choose an outcome more than once if its clear how that
affects the fiction. Some outcomes describe positive outcomes you are
likely to want. Others describe avoiding outcomes you are likely to
want to avoid. When you choose outcomes that describe positive things
you might want, they happen. Any unchosen options that describe
avoiding some outcome are invitations for the GM to inflict that
outcome on you and the story.</p>
<h2 id="principles-and-agendas"><a class="header" href="#principles-and-agendas">Principles and Agendas</a></h2>
<p>TBD but something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play to find out what happens</li>
<li>Make the world fantastic, horrific, and wondrous</li>
<li>See your characters grow and change as they discover the wonders and
horrors of the world</li>
<li>Ask provocative questions and build on the answers</li>
<li>Name everyone, give everyone humanity, villainy, or both</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="character-creation"><a class="header" href="#character-creation">Character Creation</a></h1>
<p>Character creation is very simple. Choose an
<a href="./allignment.html">allignment</a>, a <a href="./playbooks.html">playbook</a>, and a
<a href="./background.html">background</a>. Then choose pronouns, a name, and breifly
describe your look.</p>
<p>You can look ahead to see what each choice offers or you can choose
whatever catches your eye from below. Write it down as follows.</p>
<p>"I am a [allignment] [playbook]. Once a [background] but no more."</p>
<p>You might write. "I am a Divine Paladin. Once a sailer but no more"
or you might write "I am a Humble Bard. Once a farrier but no more."
There is no need to make choices that seem to go together unless
that's what you want. Feel free to write "I am a Humane Rogue. Once
a baker but no more" or whatever combination you want.</p>
<h2 id="allignment"><a class="header" href="#allignment">Allignment</a></h2>
<p>Choose one side of one of the following fundamental oppositions</p>
<ul>
<li>Lawful vs. Chaotic</li>
<li>Divine vs. Humane</li>
<li>Noble vs. Humble</li>
</ul>
<!-- * Chaste vs. Depraved -->
<!-- * Civil vs. Wild -->
<h2 id="playbooks"><a class="header" href="#playbooks">Playbooks</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>

<h2 id="world-anchors"><a class="header" href="#world-anchors">World Anchors</a></h2>
<p>The full worldbuilding process is going to take experimentation and testing.
I'm starting with <a href="https://www.wizardthieffighter.com/2019/anti-canon-worlds-and-the-uvg/">anti canon worldbuilding</a>
and <a href="https://www.mindstormpress.com/adding-congruency-to-anti-canon-worldbuilding">adding some congruency</a> to that.</p>
<p>Read those articles then come back here. For Treacherous Winds we're not going to create all our world anchoers ahead of time, we're going to discover most of them during play, but we'll create our first now.</p>
<p>Create a small corner of the larger world as your first anchor. This is the home town where all characters in a "youth" path live.</p>
<p>(Designers note: I'm not sure how well this small corner home town will work as a world anchor. Is the Two Rivers a world anchor in The Wheel of Time? Is the caravan in The Name of The Wind a world anchor?)</p>
<p>Choose from the following list or make up your own</p>
<ul>
<li>A small farming town</li>
<li>A small fishing village</li>
<li>An out of the way keep in a peaceful area</li>
<li>A traveling caravan of performers</li>
<li>A herding community</li>
<li>A mountain mining outpost</li>
<li>A woodcutting camp</li>
<li>A remote crossroads village</li>
<li>The slums of a larger city</li>
<li>The trades district of a larger city</li>
<li>An academy and its grounds</li>
<li>A temple and its grounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, with the players, answer the following questions to establish the setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we know that this is a small corner of a larger world? How are people here isolated?</li>
<li>In what small ways does this place rely on the larger world? In what small ways does the larger world rely on this place?</li>
<li>How does this place get news from the larger world and how is that news exaggerated or warped? What is some of the latest news making its way through this place?</li>
<li>What makes the culture here unique?</li>
</ul>
<p>Create your second world anchor by answering</p>
<ul>
<li>What value or ideal do the people here hold that is worthy of the wider world?</li>
</ul>
<p>Begin play by following the threads that lead from your answers.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arcs"><a class="header" href="#arcs">Arcs</a></h1>
<p>In order to highlight how characters change over time and to scaffold the creation of epic fantasy archetypes, Arcs consist of five acts.
Each act is a set of questions to watch for (and steer toward) answers to during play.</p>
<p>There are three basic arcs though each Path (Playbook) has their own variation.</p>
<p>Each PC will be working through their own Arc, and they therefore may get out of sync with each other. That's fine. Though if multiple characters have the same enemy for instance, try to get them all to the climax for the final fight with that enemy.</p>
<p>These arcs are intended to cover the length of a campaign or 10-15 sessions depending on how long you intend to play.</p>
<p>Characters don't need to retire after their Arc. Once I write the Maturity and Ascention Paths (Playbooks) and Arcs, if you complete your arc in its positive outcome (hero for the youthful Arcs) you could start a new arc from the next set of Paths (Playbooks). For instance if you just finished the Ranger you could continue through the Maturity arc as a Warden. You could even switch "tracks" and continue as a Cleric or Guildmaster if that makes sense to your story.</p>
<p>Arcs are split into 5 acts. Each act has a character development focus that the GM and the rest of the table should try to facilitate.
Each also has a set of questions and a threshold of how many need to be answered before moving on to the next act. You could approach this however you want. Either play until you notice that one of these questions has been answered, then point it out, or ask the table to deliberately drive the story towards the answer to a specific question you are interested in. Find your sweet spot.
With everyone trying to facilitate their own arcs you'll have to both help drive the story towards what the other players need and also advocate for the questions you're trying to answer. (Designers note: I have no idea how this will play out at the table. We'll just have to see)</p>
<p>At the end of Acts 1-4 choose a move from your Path (Playbook) as an advancement.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="playbooks-1"><a class="header" href="#playbooks-1">Playbooks</a></h1>
<p>Playbooks are organized into three archetypeal
categories. <strong>Youthful</strong> playbooks are for those characters going
out into the world making a name for themselves, becoming heros,
finding themselves and slaying their dragons. <strong>Maturity</strong> playbooks are for those characters
learning to lead, integrating themselves into a comminity. <strong>Ascention</strong> Playbooks are for those characters discovering
something higher, or outside this mortal realm.</p>
